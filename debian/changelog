postal (0.60) unstable; urgency=high

  * Added #include <stdlib.h> to mutex.cpp to make exit() be resolved correctly.

  * Fixed the delete percentage code for rabid.  The option "-d100:0" will mean
    that no messages get deleted.

  * Added a new version of the thread code from Bonnie++, fixes a few bugs.

  * Made the configure.in more like that from Bonnie++.

  * Added new debugging code to log to disk all network IO.

  * Made IMAP default to port 143, not that it matters much as IMAP is still
    broken.

  * Tidied up some of the error handling code.

  * Changed the threading code to monitor when threads exit so solve some
    exit time crashes.

  * Changed the header files to work with GCC 3.0.
    Closes: #99859, #104965

  * Closes: #86932
    Fixed the Build-Depends.

  * Added stdlib.h to mutex.cpp to make it compile on all systems.

  * Added rule "install-bin" to the makefile to install binaries without
    man pages, "make install" will install everything.

  * Removed the code to disable compiling with user-name conversion.  It should
    compile on all systems now!

postal (0.58) unstable; urgency=high

  * Closes:#79647
    Now removes the md5.o file on "make clean" regardless if it'll be generated
    by a compile.

  * Puts the version in Autoconf.

  * Now with new thread class with Win32 and OS/2 portability.

  * Added RPM .spec file.

  * Closes:#63973
    Was closed before but BTS didn't recognise it.

  * Closes:#71184
    Was closed before but BTS didn't recognise it.

  * Closes:#71913
    Was closed before but BTS didn't recognise it.

postal (0.57) unstable; urgency=high

  * Added extra compiler checks and fixed many trivial bugs.

  * Fixed some *BSD portability problems, should work on *BSD now.

postal (0.56) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed a bug in client.cpp that stopped compiling without SSL.

  * Closes:#71913
    Added build-depends on libssl095a-dev.

  * Changed the autoconf support for checking for C++ slightly.  It should
    now work better for some strange setups and work the same for everyone
    else (I hope).

  * Added --disable-stripping option for ./configure if you don't want binaries
    stripped.

  * Added --disable-ssl option for ./configure if you don't want to compile
    with SSL.

  * Added Solaris package manager support.

postal (0.55) unstable; urgency=low

  * Closes:#71184
    Now in "non-US" instead of "non-us".

  * Stopped rabid breaking on POP servers that support "CAPA" and added check
    for STLS in CAPA output.

  * Added better autoconf support for Solaris, now checks for link flags and
    uses int for the size of sockaddr_in instead of socklen_t on Linux or
    size_t (which the stupid Solaris documentation recommends).

  * Made rabid support not downloading all messages and not deleting all
    messages it downloads.

  * Added the following option to ./configure:
    --with-extra-libs=DIR   adds non standard library paths

  * Added Build-Depends (NOT FINISHED).

  * Fixed a warning about an unused variable for Mutex class on non-Linux.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Sat, 9 Sep 2000 10:00:52 +0100

postal (0.54) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the locking so that Rabid won't access the same account from two
    threads at the same time.  This fixes a variety of error conditions that
    a POP server can return.  Also the old buggy code may have caused Postal
    to crash in some situations.

  * Renamed class Fork to Thread.

  * Added extra gcc warning options and fixed some suspect code.

  * Added ./configure option --disable-conversion, it removes the user-name
    expansion facility and allows compilation on Slackware and BSD machines
    with broken regex headers.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Tue, 1 Aug 2000 10:46:00 +0100

postal (0.53) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed all utsname() code, so the hostname/domainname kernel values are
    not used any more at all!  Now do gethostbyaddr() to get the name of the
    local end of the connection for EHLO.  Closes: #63973

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Sun, 23 Jul 2000 17:42:48 +0100

postal (0.52) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed section to non-us/utils.

  * Added autoconf support for easier portability.  Should be almost portable
    to Solaris now.  ;)

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Sun, 23 Apr 2000 22:14:48 +0100

postal (0.51) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for compiling without SSL.

  * Some hacky support for porting to Solaris.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Thu, 20 Apr 2000 17:28:41 +0100

postal (0.50) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added SSL support.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Thu, 09 Mar 2000 18:35:59 +0100

postal (0.45) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use the OpenSSL code for MD5.
  * Use more warnings in GCC and change the code not to trigger them.
  * Pthreads code now can track return values (not using them yet though).
  * Create threads detached.
  * Made some error messages clearer.
  * Added check for blank at end of POP message.
  * Don't crash for really high rate limits.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Thu, 09 Mar 2000 18:35:59 +0100

postal (0.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed from fork() to pthreads.  This will allow easier portability with
    OS/2 and NT and also should make it a bit faster.
  * Added support for just connecting and quiting without doing anything,
    good for testing a LocalDirector.
  * Added flag for broken Netscape mail server.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Fri, 25 Feb 2000 11:41:05 +0100

postal (0.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now use getopt() for options processing.  All command-line parameters are
    now changed.
  * Changed man pages to section 8 and moved binaries to /usr/sbin, this is
    a sys-admin type program.
  * Added support for specifying which local IP address to use.  Also added
    support for specifying multiple servers (for round-robin without DNS
    configured).

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Sun, 20 Feb 2000 00:19:03 +0100

postal (0.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleaned up some of the error message code.
  * Fixed a race condition and a buffer overrun in the locking code which
    prevents multiple processes from accessing the same account.  I'm
    surprised that the previous version appeared to work properly.
  * Added rate limiting code to Postal (msgs per minute) and Rabid (connections
    per minute).
  * Added support for DNS lookups on every connection (for round-robin DNS).

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Sun, 13 Feb 2000 20:10:37 +0100

postal (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Postal now supports sending multiple messages per connection.
  * Postal now sends "EHLO" and supports multi-line responses.
  * For Postal you now specify the maximum message size not the average.
  * Hostname format now supports a preceeding '+' to specify round-robin
    DNS (IE a DNS lookup before every connection).
  * Hostname format now can be a name or IP address inside square brackets
    followed by a port number (for non-default port).
  * DNS lookup code is now in tcp.{c,h} as it should be.
  * Rabid now sends "\r\n" at the end of each line (used to send "\n").

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Thu, 10 Feb 2000 21:22:38 +0100

postal (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the headers bug.
  * Debugged Rabid, it seems to work perfectly now. ;)
  * Postal now adds an md5 checksum to all messages it sends.
  * Rabid now checks the md5 checksum's on messages it receives that have an
    X-Postal header field.  It displays an error message on a mis-match.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Mon, 7 Feb 2000 16:55:00 +0100

postal (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the stats report more accurately and faster.
  * Added "Rabid" the POP benchmark (still needs some debugging).
  * Made the code more object oriented and portable.
  * Added the postal-list program to list all the possible ways of expanding
    names.

 -- Russell Coker <russell@coker.com.au>  Fri, 4 Feb 2000 22:02:38 +0100
