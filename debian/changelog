postal (0.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed from fork() to pthreads.  This will allow easier portability with
    OS/2 and NT and also should make it a bit faster.
  * Added support for just connecting and quiting without doing anything,
    good for testing a LocalDirector.
  * Added flag for broken Netscape mail server.

postal (0.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now use getopt() for options processing.  All command-line parameters are
    now changed.
  * Changed man pages to section 8 and moved binaries to /usr/sbin, this is
    a sys-admin type program.
  * Added support for specifying which local IP address to use.  Also added
    support for specifying multiple servers (for round-robin without DNS
    configured).

postal (0.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleaned up some of the error message code.
  * Fixed a race condition and a buffer overrun in the locking code which
    prevents multiple processes from accessing the same account.  I'm
    surprised that the previous version appeared to work properly.
  * Added rate limiting code to Postal (msgs per minute) and Rabid (connections
    per minute).
  * Added support for DNS lookups on every connection (for round-robin DNS).

postal (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Postal now supports sending multiple messages per connection.
  * Postal now sends "EHLO" and supports multi-line responses.
  * For Postal you now specify the maximum message size not the average.
  * Hostname format now supports a preceeding '+' to specify round-robin
    DNS (IE a DNS lookup before every connection).
  * Hostname format now can be a name or IP address inside square brackets
    followed by a port number (for non-default port).
  * DNS lookup code is now in tcp.{c,h} as it should be.
  * Rabid now sends "\r\n" at the end of each line (used to send "\n").

postal (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the headers bug.
  * Debugged Rabid, it seems to work perfectly now. ;)
  * Postal now adds an md5 checksum to all messages it sends.
  * Rabid now checks the md5 checksum's on messages it receives that have an
    X-Postal header field.  It displays an error message on a mis-match.
